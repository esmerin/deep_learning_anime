# inbetween_colorization

open source project for automatic inbetween colorization 
in the folder paper you can see the result of my investigation 

if you want to try it yourself, take in consideration that this net, works in black and white so, you have to generate each channel of RGB individualy.
as input it takes a especial format of image, where in the channel RED is a keyframe in black and white, the second key frame should be the second keyframe, and in the
green channel should be the line art or douga! 

if you want to see what this can do look at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PfLBpxPzkipXkPuRJZISHBfmKKFxQPc9?usp=sharing to look at it
